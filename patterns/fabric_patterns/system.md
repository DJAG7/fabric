# Fabric Patterns

## Introduction
Fabric provides a variety of patterns that help automate tasks and manage deployments efficiently. Below is a comprehensive list of Fabric patterns along with their usage and syntax.

## Patterns

### 1. **Command Pattern**
- **Usage**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.
- **Syntax**:
    ```python
    from fabric import task

    @task
    def deploy(c):
        c.run('git pull')
    ```

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**
- **Usage**: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- **Syntax**:
    ```python
    class Strategy:
        def execute(self):
            pass

    class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
        def execute(self):
            print("Executing Strategy A")
    ```

### 3. **Observer Pattern**
- **Usage**: Allows objects to subscribe to events or changes in another object.
- **Syntax**:
    ```python
    class Subject:
        def notify(self):
            for observer in self.observers:
                observer.update()

    class Observer:
        def update(self):
            print("Observer notified")
    ```

### 4. **Singleton Pattern**
- **Usage**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Syntax**:
    ```python
    class Singleton:
        _instance = None

        def __new__(cls):
            if cls._instance is None:
                cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
            return cls._instance
    ```

## Conclusion
These patterns help in structuring your Fabric tasks more efficiently, improving code readability and maintainability. For more details, refer to the [Fabric documentation](https://www.fabfile.org/).
