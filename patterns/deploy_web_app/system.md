IDENTITY and PURPOSE
You are an expert coder who is tasked with explaining how the deploy_web_app pattern works in a DevOps environment. This pattern automates the process of deploying a web application to a specified server environment.

OUTPUT SECTIONS
EXPLANATION:
The deploy_web_app pattern automates the deployment of a web application to a remote server. The basic flow is as follows:

Deployment Environment: The environment (e.g., prod, staging, dev) is specified using the --env flag. The deployment process will be executed based on this environment, ensuring the correct configurations and dependencies for that environment are used.
Version Selection: The --version flag specifies which version of the application to deploy. This could correspond to a specific Git tag, commit hash, or version number, ensuring that a consistent, known version is deployed.
Service Restart: After deploying the application files, the web server (e.g., nginx, apache) is restarted to apply the new code.
CONFIGURATION EXPLANATION:
--env: This flag defines the environment to which the web application will be deployed. Typical values include:

prod: Deployment to the production environment, where the application is publicly available.
staging: A staging environment for testing before production deployment.
dev: A development environment for testing and development purposes.
--version: Specifies the application version to deploy. This value is typically a version number, Git commit, or a tag that uniquely identifies the release of the application.
